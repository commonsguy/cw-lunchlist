Welcome to the source code for Android Programming Tutorials (http://commonsware.com/AndTutorials)!

The names of the top-level directories roughly correspond to a
shortened form of the chapter titles. Since chapter numbers
change with every release, and since some samples are used by
multiple chapters, I am loathe to put chapter numbers in the
actual directory names.

If you wish to use this code, bear in mind a few things:

* The projects are set up to be built by Ant, not by Eclipse.
	If you wish to use the code with Eclipse, you will need to
	create a suitable Android Eclipse project and import the
	code and other assets.

* You should delete build.xml from the project, then run

		android update project -p ...
  (where ... is the path to a project of interest)

	on those projects you wish to use, so the build files are
	updated for your Android SDK version.

This book has undergone several revisions, and the source
code as well. The source tree is tagged to match the various
book versions.
